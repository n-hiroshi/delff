# SPhG
SPhG(Sparse Pharmacophore Graph)

This library contains all of the required files to compute Sparse Pharmacophore Graphs 
and clustering/visualization methods of a group of SPhGs for understanding ligand design convepts.

For more information, please read :

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The following libraries are required:

*[Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.8/) version 3.8.16

*[JAX] version 0.4.2

*[JAXOPT] version 0.6

*[SciPy] version 1.10.1

*[NumPy](https://scipy.org/install.html) version 1.23.5

*[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) version 2.0.1

*[LAMMPS](https://lammps.org) release 27 May 2021

*[Gaussian](https://gaussian.com) version 16.B01

The operability of the versios at the side of the libary names were confirmed. 

### Installation

Installation is completed by copying this whole library to your local computer.

### Test

The following commands let you comfirm the successfull installation
with a sample dataset in the same directory as _alltests.sh_.
All of the usecases are included in the test programs.

```
cd [installation directory]/delff/test/
python main_lattice_[molecule name].py [ID] [FDM/SDM]
```
[molecule_name] = acanil/antcen/benzac/biphen/bpheno/naphol/pencen/tphben
[ID] = any numbers from 0 to 999 indicating the folder name
in which omputed results will be stored.
[FDM/SDM] = force field optimization methods discussed in the paper.


### Further information

The documants of 'Read the docs'(https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) format is generated by the command:

```
cd [installation directory]/delff
./autosphinx.sh
```
